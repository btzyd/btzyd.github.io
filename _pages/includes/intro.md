I am Yudong Zhang (张宇东), a PhD candidate in [NICS-EFC Laboratory](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Yu Wang (汪玉)](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangyu/en/). I completed my bachelor's degree in [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by Professor [Jiansheng Chen (陈健生)](https://jschenthu.weebly.com/).

My research focuses on enhancing the safety and efficiency of vision-language models. To date, I have authored or co-authored 11 peer-reviewed papers, including 6 first-author publications in academic conferences such as AAAI, ACM Multimedia (ACMMM), EMNLP and NAACL, with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6bsN3RYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> citations to date.

Currently, I am an intern at Tencent's Hunyuan team, mentored by [Xingwu Sun (孙兴武)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rjC51OsAAAAJ) and [Ruobing Xie (谢若冰)](https://ruobingxie.github.io/). I focus on pre-training of large language models.

If you are interested in academic collaboration or would like to discuss potential research opportunities, please feel free to reach out via email [zhangyd16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:zhangyd16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).

I will be graduating in June 2026 and I am looking for job opportunities.
